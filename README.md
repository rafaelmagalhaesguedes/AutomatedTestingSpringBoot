# Products Microservice API (ms-products-api)

## üíª Project

The project is highly focused on ensuring code quality and reliability
through a wide range of **automated tests**, including **unit** tests,
**integration**, **end-to-end** and **mutant** testing. Use Jacoco for coverage analysis
of tests. Technologies used include Spring Boot Test, JUnit 5, Mockito,
AssertJ, Hamcrest, JsonPath, Jacoco and Pitest.
